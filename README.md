Hello anyone coming across this project, this is Integrordle, a Wordle-esc integral led version of the New York Times game.

I hope you enjoy!

The IDE to run the server necessary to start the project can be installed at this link:
 - LINK HERE: https://spring.io/tools
   - Download "Spring Tools 4 Eclipse" for your OS   
 - Once installed, open a workspace and import the project as a maven > existing maven project
 - After this, navigate to the MathLingoApplication.java file, click the drop down next to the play button and navigate to run as > spring boot app

Good luck and Happy Integrordling!

Sincerely,
Cai Scheidler
